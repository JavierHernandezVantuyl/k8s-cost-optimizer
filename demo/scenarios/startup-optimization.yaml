name: Startup Cost Emergency
description: |
  TechStart Inc. is a Series A startup running a SaaS platform on AWS.
  They're burning $45,000/month on infrastructure and need to cut costs
  before their next funding round in 2 weeks.

initial_state:
  monthly_cost: 45000
  clusters:
    - name: production-cluster
      provider: aws
      region: us-east-1
      node_count: 25
      workloads: 45

  pain_points:
    - Over-provisioned resources from rapid growth
    - No autoscaling configured
    - Running everything on-demand instances
    - Multiple small deployments that could be consolidated

  business_constraints:
    - Cannot have downtime during business hours (9 AM - 6 PM EST)
    - Must maintain current performance levels
    - Limited DevOps resources (2 engineers)
    - Need quick wins within 2 weeks
