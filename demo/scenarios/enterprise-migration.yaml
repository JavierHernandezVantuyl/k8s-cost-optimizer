# Enterprise Multi-Cloud Migration Scenario
#
# Scenario: Large enterprise optimizing across AWS, GCP, and Azure
# Scale: 500+ workloads, $850K/month infrastructure spend

name: Enterprise Multi-Cloud Optimization
description: |
  Global Corp operates workloads across AWS, GCP, and Azure.
  Goal: Optimize placement and reduce costs by 35-40% ($300K+/month)

initial_state:
  monthly_cost: 850000
  clusters:
    aws_production: {cost: 450000, workloads: 280, region: "us-east-1"}
    aws_europe: {cost: 180000, workloads: 120, region: "eu-west-1"}
    gcp_analytics: {cost: 150000, workloads: 80, region: "us-central1"}
    azure_ml: {cost: 70000, workloads: 50, region: "eastus"}

optimization_areas:
  cross_cloud_optimization:
    savings: 180000
    strategies:
      - Move analytics to GCP (better pricing)
      - Consolidate AWS regions
      - Use Azure spot for ML training
